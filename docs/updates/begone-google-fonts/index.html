<p>Okay, that&#39;s a far more dramatic title than this update really is. Long story short: I live in Europe, and <a href="https://rewis.io/urteile/urteil/lhm-20-01-2022-3-o-1749320/">German court has ruled</a> that using Google Font&#39;s API to serve fonts (as opposed to hosting locally) breaks GDPR. I will be using <a href="https://fonts.bunny.net">Bunny Fonts</a> instead, which claims to be a &quot;privacy-first web font platform designed to put privacy back into the internet&quot;.</p>
