<p>After thinking about it, I&#39;m going to no longer link to my Twitter and Instagram accounts, since I want no part of the first one and don&#39;t really use the second one. With that said, I&#39;ve started looking at PixelFed (a Fediverse Instagram), and will see about getting a habit to post on there instead.</p>
