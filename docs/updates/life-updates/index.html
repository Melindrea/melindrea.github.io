<p>I haven&#39;t been able to keep up with this lately, but stuff has been going on, so here&#39;s a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joined a mastodon server for the shop at <a href="https://handmade.social/@melindrea">https://handmade.social/@melindrea</a></li>
<li>Started and then paused streaming--battery on my computer can&#39;t handle heavier load</li>
<li>Started christmas gifts and have finished some</li>
<li>Considering commission and shop items around both paracord and spiritual things (bracelets, keyfobs, lanyards, cane wristlets and tarot wraps)</li>
</ul>
