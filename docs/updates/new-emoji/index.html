<p>I&#39;ve made an emoji that I&#39;m quite pleased over. <img src="/assets/images/autistic-lurker.png" alt="Emoji face with eyes averting contact and focusing on the giant mug of something in front of it. There's a rainbow infinity sign on the mug" height="250" width="250"> It&#39;s called &quot;autistic lurker&quot; and is on at least one mastodon instance at the moment. If you have a mastodon instance and would like to use it, it&#39;s free with attribution to me (you can link to my website). I&#39;ll likely put up a section with downloads, but for now, I&#39;ll link it here.</p>
