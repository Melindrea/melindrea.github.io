It's possible the question posed by the title doesn't make sense to you--maybe you met me on Mastodon, and while I've moved around some, I've been more-or-less active there for the last few years. This, however, isn't about my social media presence, but rather about this site. I made it, wrote a few posts (and smaller updates) and then stopped updating. It's now 2024, and the copyright on my site was 22-23 ...

Well, the first (and most important) bit is that the computer I bought off of work (an old macbook on its last legs) finally crashed and I was forced to get a new computer. Since I couldn't afford a macbook (and unfortunately the art for my older images are on the dead computer), I moved to Windows, including with all the code. You know, all the code I'd developed on MacOS because there was no chance of me having a non-*nix computer? Yeah. Things broke, badly, and I decided I didn't have the energy to deal with it.

Especially since I still live wih chronic pain (medication took it down from ~6-7 on a normal day to ~5 or even 4, but I have worse days still), and I got an explanation for a lot of my past concerns (why I have trouble *starting things*, why peopling seems to be harder on me than on the general person, why no one else talks about their strategies for dealing with, say, unable to get going ...): I'm autistic. At this point I have the actual diagnosis too, with lots of big words that explain so much, at least to me.

### What's next?
Well, first we have the slight issue that while I have the steps I took (thank you [past me!](/blog/posts/new-site/)), there might be something that's still on the dead computer that I'll have to rework, but it should be fine. Much to my amazement, apparently past me had also fixed the python script that I use to generate images, which is nice.

I'm planning on (once things are settled) reworking the site's design, likely tear out TailwindCSS for something more custom, though it's fine for now. And I really don't want to remove the typefaces--Cormorant and Montserrat work together quite nicely. I'm also wanting to get some more stuff working (like sharing posts to mastodon with a single command) and clean up some of my older code. But, for now, I'm back with having a proper website, and life is okay.
