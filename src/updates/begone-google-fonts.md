title: Begone! Google fonts
---

Okay, that's a far more dramatic title than this update really is. Long story short: I live in Europe, and [German court has ruled](https://rewis.io/urteile/urteil/lhm-20-01-2022-3-o-1749320/) that using Google Font's API to serve fonts (as opposed to hosting locally) breaks GDPR. I will be using [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net) instead, which claims to be a "privacy-first web font platform designed to put privacy back into the internet".
