title: Bye Twitter and Instagram, hello PixelFed
---

After thinking about it, I'm going to no longer link to my Twitter and Instagram accounts, since I want no part of the first one and don't really use the second one. With that said, I've started looking at PixelFed (a Fediverse Instagram), and will see about getting a habit to post on there instead.
