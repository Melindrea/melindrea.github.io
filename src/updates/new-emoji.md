title: I've made an emoji!

I've made an emoji that I'm quite pleased over. <img src="/assets/images/autistic-lurker.png" alt="Emoji face with eyes averting contact and focusing on the giant mug of something in front of it. There's a rainbow infinity sign on the mug" height="250" width="250"> It's called "autistic lurker" and is on at least one mastodon instance at the moment. If you have a mastodon instance and would like to use it, it's free with attribution to me (you can link to my website). I'll likely put up a section with downloads, but for now, I'll link it here.
